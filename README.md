# fabric-inspection
Fabric inspection is often known as fabric checking. It is a method of identifying flaws in a fabric. Fabric inspection occurs throughout the production process, including intermediate and final stages. Automatic fabric fault detection by using a deep learning algorithm. The main domain of this research work is computer vision. during the fabric-making process, there could be some fault under the process. Our main objective is to find out the reliable process that could change the manual fabric inspection process.
